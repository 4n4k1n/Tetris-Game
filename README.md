# Tetris Terminal Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game that runs directly in the terminal. The game is built in C and uses the `ncurses` library for handling terminal graphics and input.

## Features

- You can play Tetris ^^.


## Prerequisites

Before you can compile and run the game, ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- `ncurses` library
- `sqlite3` library

### Installing Dependencies

#### On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3 libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

## Alias

You can use the setAlias.sh file to create a Alias in the .zshrc and .bash_aliases file.
The Alias goes to the directory where the game is located and runs it. Just type `tetris`.

```bash
bash setAlias.sh
```

## Compilation

To compile the game, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable file named `tetris`.

## Running the Game

Once compiled, you can run the game using:

```bash
./tetris
```

## Controls

- **A / D / W**: Move the tetromino left or right, or rotate it.
- **Space**: Hard drop the tetromino.
- **Down Arrow**: Soft drop.
- **Z**: Hold the tetromino.
- **ESC**: Quit the game.
- (You can change the controls)
